# Outline and code to create a possible paper summarising PMIP4+ and PMIP7 paper

_Rationale:_ This manuscript is intended as a position piece to motivate PMIP7. It will also attempt to summarise the results arising from PMIP4, and categorise which bits of that science happened after AR6.

### Introduction
* Talk about past climate changes as an independent test of model
* Historical background on PMIP
* Explain set-up of PMIP4 and some facts about its inclusion in AR6

### Past climates
* Explain the spread of periods (intro paragraph setting up WGs; then short paragraph on each)
  * mid-Holocene
  * last glacial maximum
  * Last interglacial
  * Pliocene
  * early Eocene
  * past2k

* Include table providing a summary. Base on IPCC AR6 TS table, with # models in each (Chris)

### Insights into past climates
_I'm not so sure what wants to go in this section: ideas?_
* lig127k was new inclusion in CMIP6. Lots of focus on Arctic - learnt that it was seasonally ice-free(?) and only few models can capture this
* Some examples on the regional level?
* Maybe discuss how the model simulations can support insights being drawn from data: [Wharton et al](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07655-y) and [Gray et al](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2023PA004666) as examples?

* Discuss role of data assimilation generated 'reconstructions'. Highlight possible circularity. Can I add in Osman and Erb for MH. Osman for LGM and Tierney for Pliocene? 

### Benchmarking

* Provide a (brief) literature review of the benchmarking performed before: separate papers for periods; attempt to combine in IPCC

* Pull together the existing results from the various single-period papers into a single carpet diagram (mainly temp, but also a few hydroclimate). Include a single line for the historical temp trend (from general obs paper: take from CVDP?)

* Talk about benchmarks and evaluation performed on other fields (e.g. ENSO in midH, salinity/density). Synthesise regional evaluations.

### Insights for future climate _(Gabrial Pontes)_

* A brief paragraph talking about the benefit of past for future insights.
* Paragraph summarising multi-model studies that include the future: drawing connections within model world
* Paragraph looking at paleo-constraints. Discuss Lunt et al (2024) constraining ECS directly using PMIP outputs. Jiang Zhu's palaeo-calibrated CESM2 and Peter Hopcroft's work
* Paragraph pushing into work explaining the physical mechanisms: e.g. Yoshimori et al; He at al
* Any quantitative examples (maybe Osman et al 2026)

* Brief description of CMIP7, and slightly shifted nature of PMIP within it
* Describe abrupt127k experiment and focus on Arctic
* Explain expansion into Miocene
* Data assimilation and shift in focus of past2k simulation
* Proxy modelling as a benchmarking approach (with mid-Holocene)?
* Suggest something about near-term timings
* Wider vision and summary
